# Daily Blog

### Introduction
Here within this repository, I'll be keeping my blog.  
It'll consist of short daily notes describing what I've accomplished and my plans for tomorrow. It will also include helpful links to materials, books, and articles I've read or used in my learning journey. Hopefully, it'll be useful to someone or stay just as my notes in learning graphics programming.  
  
**I'll start with my goal:**  
I want to learn the foundation of computer graphics programming within a year, focusing mainly on the low-level details of implementing 3D rendering engines. I aim to gain the necessary basis to work in technical developer roles (those who write the layer between hardware APIs and engines or directly work on low-level engine layers) in top companies like NVIDIA, AMD, PlayStation, Xbox, and similar ones. To achieve this, I'll dedicate myself to studying this topic and developing pet projects for 3-4 hours every day.
