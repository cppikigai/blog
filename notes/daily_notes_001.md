### March 10, 2024. Day 0.
Today I'll start with an introductory note where I'll outline my plan for tomorrow.
Firstly, I'm going to describe the projects I'll be working on. There will be at least 4 repositories:
* [algorithms_kata](https://github.com/cppikigai/algorithms_kata): This repository will showcase my solutions to algorithmic problems from websites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It's for practicing problem-solving skills often required in interviews.
* [tiny_software_renderer](https://github.com/cppikigai/tiny_software_renderer): This project will help me understand the basics of rendering. I'll be implementing rendering functionalities similar to popular graphics APIs but with my implementation on CPU.
* [common_tasks](https://github.com/cppikigai/common_tasks): This project will contain typical problems and their solutions. It will include interesting concepts that deserve attention and can be solved within a single file or function.
* Lastly, I'll work on a renderer using one of the modern APIs, or maybe multiple at once.

Over the 365 days, or one year, I plan to study all the fundamental algorithmic problems and write a software renderer. Through these projects, I aim to learn the essential skills required for my future job.

**Now, onto tomorrow's plan:**
* Implement window creation using [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and rendering the screen buffer via the OpenGL API for my software renderer.
* Add primitive helper classes for drawing lines based on coordinates and displaying them on the screen.
* Add basic classes for working with 2D and 3D vectors. I intentionally want to use my own math library to refresh my understanding of the underlying mathematics.
* Besides these tasks, I'm also reading [Bjarne Stroustrup's book on C++11](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840) to refresh my knowledge. I'm reading it cover to cover, so this task will take around two weeks or more. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get acquainted with the language.
This is just the beginning of my journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. Stay tuned for more updates!
